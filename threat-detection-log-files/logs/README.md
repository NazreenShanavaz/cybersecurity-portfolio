## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes log files using a Python script and flags suspicious events like:

- Failed login attempts  
- Unauthorized access  
- Malware detection

It demonstrates how **Security Analysts** can automate log monitoring to protect systems and identify early warning signs of threats.
